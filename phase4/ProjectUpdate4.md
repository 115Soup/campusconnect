**SCHEDULED MEETING TIMES**
- Mondays at 1700 PST
- A flexible meeting time during the week, determined based on members' availability. This additional meeting aims to address unexpected developments, monitor progress, and facilitate post-meeting reflections.

In case a team member is unable to attend a meeting, we have established a robust system for communicating updates, progress, and tasks through our designated communication channels, primarily using Discord. This ensures that no team member falls behind and enables them to catch up on meeting discussions.

**Overall Team Update**
This phase was spent on finalizing the implementation of the notifications and animations created by Saad. This features were also supplemented by the creation of the CampusConnect logo by Jordan, attached below. As we continue work on the Groups feature which is planned to be the next goal we will continue to finalize the design of the site and prepare for additional features.
