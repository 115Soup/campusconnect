**CONFLICT RESOLUTION SCHEMES**
In the event of disagreements, our team will prioritize open communication among members to understand varying perspectives. If a consensus cannot be reached, we will conduct a democratic vote among team members. Should the conflict persist, we will seek guidance from our instructor to make a final decision.

**SCHEDULED MEETING TIMES**
- Mondays at 1700 PST
- A flexible meeting time during the week, determined based on members' availability. This additional meeting aims to address unexpected developments, monitor progress, and facilitate post-meeting reflections.

In case a team member is unable to attend a meeting, we have established a robust system for communicating updates, progress, and tasks through our designated communication channels, primarily using Discord. This ensures that no team member falls behind and enables them to catch up on meeting discussions.


**INITIAL PROJECT IDEA**
Campus Connect is an online social directory web application meticulously designed to foster connections among students and faculty within the academic community. The primary objective of Campus Connect is to facilitate seamless interaction by providing a user-friendly landing page showcasing user profiles. To ensure the authenticity of its users, Campus Connect will seek to leverage email based authentication.

Campus Connect's core vision revolves around the simple and ethical concept of unifying the campus community. Both students and faculty members are afforded the opportunity to curate comprehensive profiles, thereby enabling others to engage with and gain insights into their academic personas. It transcends conventional bulletin boards or information platforms, serving as a comprehensive online directory housing profiles of individuals who opt to share pertinent information about themselves.



**Key Features of Campus Connect**:

1. **User Profile Management**:
   - Enable users to seamlessly create and manage their individual profiles.
   - Provide an elegant interface for the presentation of student and faculty profiles already present on the platform.

2. **Email Verification System**:
   - In the upcoming stages of development,we will seek to implement a robust email verification system, enforcing user authentication through a link-based confirmation process.

3. **Interactive Communication**:
   - Another area we look to tackle will be that of user interaction. We look forward to implementing this either be it in the forms of  comments or/and likes under user's post as well as the ability to follow profiles users find interesting and beneficial.



 Aside from the features already listed above, Campus Connect exhibits significant potential for future scalability, which includes the addition of dynamic features like advanced user interactivity, messaging capabilities, and dedicated sections for diverse campus activities. Conversely, should time constraints or resource limitations necessitate a more streamlined approach, the core functionality of profile viewing can be emphasized without compromising the essence of the project.

**PROJECT UPDATES**
The initial project idea is currently progressing as anticipated, with significant updates having been implemented at this juncture. Any changes to this status will be promptly documented and communicated. Detailed specifications and execution methods are available in the Specifications.md document.
