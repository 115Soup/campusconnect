**SCHEDULED MEETING TIMES**
- Mondays at 1700 PST
- A flexible meeting time during the week, determined based on members' availability. This additional meeting aims to address unexpected developments, monitor progress, and facilitate post-meeting reflections.

In case a team member is unable to attend a meeting, we have established a robust system for communicating updates, progress, and tasks through our designated communication channels, primarily using Discord. This ensures that no team member falls behind and enables them to catch up on meeting discussions.

**Team Standards Update**
No major changes were are required at this time in Team Standards. Only different to coding standards is introduction of some Java script components that will be utilized as project continues. With the current goal of implementing animations onto the current layout of the website, CSS is being utilized as mentioned in Standards.md

**Team Version Control Update**
Team Version Control is still following same procedure as before mentioned in Standards.md with the use of a public GitHub. Joe is the main version control specialist of the team and runs the GitHub having main control of the master branch for project updates. With each of our team members working on certain components: HTML, and CSS we each have our own branch off the testing branch where testing is occuring. This allows for a safe push and pull between testing branch while keeping our finished tested product on the master.

**Product Specifications Update**
Additional feature to update in Specifications is the rollout of our Notfications page. This feature is still being bug tested but has most of the major components working:

Added as Feature 6 of Specifications:
Users are given the ability to monitor activity of other users they follow. On clicking on the notifications page now added on the website, a user may see likes on their post, comments, and new posts made by other users. This is more of a speciality feature than a required feature that will allow easier access and communications with others by having a quick link to new conversations other users generate. 
This page contains no fields but rather many direct links to other users and users posts allowing them to constantly have to click on others profile to see recent activity.
