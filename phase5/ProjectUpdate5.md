**SCHEDULED MEETING TIMES**
- Mondays at 1700 PST
- A flexible meeting time during the week, determined based on members' availability. This additional meeting aims to address unexpected developments, monitor progress, and facilitate post-meeting reflections.

In case a team member is unable to attend a meeting, we have established a robust system for communicating updates, progress, and tasks through our designated communication channels, primarily using Discord. This ensures that no team member falls behind and enables them to catch up on meeting discussions.

**Overall Team Update**
This phase was spent primarily on the development of TestPlan.md. As well as continuation of progress made on the Groups page and Logo implementation. Therefore there is no major updates made to relevant documentation rather development is in progress on the additional features that were added into the documents in advance. Depending on the timeline there will likely be finalization to the supporting documents during the final phase.
