## Testing Techniques

### Overview of Techniques for CampusConnect Testing

CampusConnect is a web application with the goal of connecting students with other students to help answer questions. Due to user actions being the driving factor behind how data is processed and created on the application testing techniques will follow a similar aspect throughout the entire program. This includes solely descriptive user scripts. This will involve actions performed on each individual page as discussed in the design document: Signup, Login, MyProfile, Home, Discover, Notifications, and Settings. These user action scripts will detail specific behaviour the user will perform and expected end-to-end behaviour for each scenario.

## Test Infrastructure

### Script Descriptions

Test Infrastructure for CampusConnect will advise the tester of specific user actions to be performed on each page with expected output in UserActionScripts.md. This will allow the active tester to have guidelines on what is to be expected from each page and allow for accurate testing and bug fixing for us as the programmers.
